        # Bulk update event contribution list

        This form is for contributors who have participated in multiple Creatorsgarten events but don't see themselves on the event contributor lists.

        Adding yourself to individual event pages can be tedious when you've been involved in multiple events, so we created this form to streamline the process.

        ## Prerequisites

        Before proceeding, make sure you have a public profile on our wiki. Your name must be listed on the [People page](https://wiki.creatorsgarten.org/people).

        If you don't have a profile yet, see [creating a public profile](https://wiki.creatorsgarten.org/people#creating-a-public-profile).
